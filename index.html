    <h1>What is a Mimic?</h1>
    <p>Mimics are fascinating creatures in the Dungeons and Dragons mythos.<br>
      Dungeons and Dragons, more commonly referred to as "DND" or "D&D"<br>
      is a fantasy role-playing game first created in 1974.<br>
      In D&D, a very infamous monster for the players to face against is the Mimic.<br> 
      Mimics are known for hiding in plain sight.<br>
      They are named after what they do, which is to imitate some non-living, inanimate object.<br>
      The typical form they take is that of a chest. With large teeth suprising the players<br>

    <!--Final section on History of Mimics-->
    <h1>History of Mimics:</h1>
    <p>The Mimics first appeared in 1977's <i>Monster Manual</i> by Gary Gygax<br> <!--Using italics for name of book-->
      Gygax was one of the co-founders of the game of D&D itself.<br>
      The depiction of a Mimic has changed a lot as can be seen from the first depiction below.<br>
    </p>

    <p>In 1983, Ed Greenwood produced a more coherent knowledge base for mimic history.<br>
      He created the idea that mimics consisted of two types:<br> 
      <b>Small neutral mimics that might help the players</b> and <b>Large violent mimics with little intelligence</b><br><br> <!--Bolding important information-->
      In 1995, Discworld was released, which introduced a helpful companion called <b>Luggage</b><br>
      Luggage acted as the player's pet, which was a large change from other iterations of the mimic.<br><br>

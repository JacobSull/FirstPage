GUI Assignment: Creating Your First Web Page
-This Web Page gives some information on my favorite monster (The Mimic) from a game I enjoy called D&D.
-I gave some basic information and some statitics of the creature, using a table.
-I linked to some other sites for more information and also used css styling to make the page look nicer.
-I used some slight styling in html with bolding and italicizing certain parts.
